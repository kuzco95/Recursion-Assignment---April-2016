# Recursion Assignment - April 2016
 Completed this assignment to demonstrate my understanding of recursion in Java. The program has three main parts. The first part takes user input to calculate a factorial. The second part prints a string entered by the user in reverse order. The final part uses recursion to make an impressive fractal image.
